More recently, 50% shorter working blades and a 3mm extended shank (called Gracey Access) have gained popularity for periodontally involved cases. We have taken the Gracey Access design one step further and thinned the working blade to improve root concavity and furcation access beyond 4 mm.The complexity of a shorter working end makes it difficult to sharpen in stainless steel. With XP Technology’s reduced wear rate, the Thin Gracey Access design will retain the original 70-degree edge angulation for consistent periodontal instrumentation.The Thin Gracey Access 1 Quik-Tip curette is useful in pockets greater than 4mm in all anterior areas, as well as buccal and lingual molar furcations.",Plak Smacker,Hand Instruments,https://www.youngspecialties.com/product/american-eagle-xp-sharpen-free-thin-gracey-access-1-quik-tip-curette-1-ct/,"https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/American-Eagle-XP-Thin-Gracey-Access-1-QuikTip-Curette-AEGA16XPQT-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/American-Eagle-XP-Thin-Gracey-Access-1-QuikTip-Curette-AEGA16XPQT-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/American-Eagle-XP-Thin-Gracey-Access-1-QuikTip-Curette-AEGA16XPQT-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/American-Eagle-XP-Thin-Gracey-Access-1-QuikTip-Curette-AEGA16XPQT-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/American-Eagle-XP-Thin-Gracey-Access-1-QuikTip-Curette-AEGA16XPQT-32x32.jpg 32w, https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/American-Eagle-XP-Thin-Gracey-Access-1-QuikTip-Curette-AEGA16XPQT-190x190.jpg 190w, https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/American-Eagle-XP-Thin-Gracey-Access-1-QuikTip-Curette-AEGA16XPQT-100x100.jpg 100w, https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/American-Eagle-XP-Thin-Gracey-Access-1-QuikTip-Curette-AEGA16XPQT-60x60.jpg 60w, https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/American-Eagle-XP-Thin-Gracey-Access-1-QuikTip-Curette-AEGA16XPQT-90x90.jpg 90w, https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/American-Eagle-XP-Thin-Gracey-Access-1-QuikTip-Curette-AEGA16XPQT.jpg 1000w"
