We opened up the angle for better reach over the teeth, made the blade longer (6mm), and balanced the blade so it won't spin in the hand.  Its long, fine blade allows practitioners to reach into those deep pockets and furcations where perio disease lurks.

Emergency Face Shields are 100% manufactured from PET polyethylene, an advanced polymer with good clarity, easy manufacturability, and safe for food and skin contact.   Most bottled water and soda sold in the US are in PET containers.  PET does not contain BPA or phthalates, and PET is fully recyclable
The Face Shield can be cleaned with common clinical disinfectants including bleach solutions, quaternary ammonium, glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide and alcohol.  Follow your healthcare facility's cleaning protocol.
This is not a medical mask.  It is intended for use by healthcare providers as a splash guard to reduce patient secretions and droplets from contacting the healthcare providers face

Not PAPR compatible - Emergency Face Shields are a simple plastic covering from the forehead to neck and ear to ear.  They should never be worn in an environment where PAPR use is required or mandated. 
Made in the USA.  The PET plastic raw material is domestically produced and sheet extruded in the US also.

Emergency Face Shields do NOT claim to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.  Emergency Face Shields do NOT filter surgical smoke, viruses, bacteria, or fungi.  Emergency Face Shields are to be used solely at the discretion of the healthcare provider, and never in a situation which mandates Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR).",,,Infection Control/Protective Eyewear,https://www.dentalcity.com/product/19919/dental-city-emergency-face-shield,,https://www.dentalcity.com/CatalogImages/DENLN/18-19919-Product_Primary_Image-400X400.jpg
