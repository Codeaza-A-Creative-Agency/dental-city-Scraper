The patented .020 slot and higher appliance torque values allow you to accurately and easily vary torque to meet the requirements of each individual patient by simply choosing the appropriate larger or smaller dimension rectangular or square archwire.Additionally, the “proportionality” between popular straight wires systems allows the VTA™ system to replicate the actual torque values of most popular prescriptions simply by varying archwire size.Most torquing applications can be performed using less than full-size archwires relative to the bracket slot.

Young Specialists,AK1001,Young Specialists,AK1001,BurtonBands Anterior Kit,"NEW! BurtonBands Anterior Matrix System Superior gingival seal. Limited flash. Faster restorations.Designed by Dr. Matthew Burton, DDSNatural-looking anterior restorations rely on proper contour and embrasure placement. These critical components are difficult to perfect using plastic matrix systems that can restrict access to the restoration. The BurtonBands Anterior Matrix System aids in forming the proximal wall, while giving you full control to properly sculpt and shape the facial and lingual embrasures prior to polymerization, which produces superior results and significantly reduces finishing time. The BurtonBands system provides a constant in an otherwise highly variable environment, which results in more consistent and efficient restorations.Design: Benefits: Kit includes: 30-Day Money Back Guarantee: Try BurtonBands risk-free for 30 days. If you’re not completely satisfied with your purchase, call (800) 558-6684 for a full refund.Video Demonstration: The design features a 38 micron metal matrix attached to a plastic wedge.The notched wedge clicks into place, stabilizing the matrix and freeing both hands for restoration.The matrix is contoured yet flexible, allowing it to follow the shape of the tooth from the root surface to the incisal edge.The wedge has a unique handle design. The square head can be placed with fingers or cotton tweezers. No special tools are required.Provides full access to the restoration resulting in improved facial embrasure formation and the ability to properly shape and position the incisal embrasure.Allows for easy placement in a single step without the need for extensive matrix modifications.The metal matrix is burnishable and thinner than plastic strips, which allows for control over contour and proximal contact.Creates a slight separation between the teeth, improving proximal contact formation.Significantly decreases post-polymerization finishing time.Consistently seals the gingival margin while allowing access to hard-to-reach subgingival caries, which eliminates isolation issues, excess flash and overhanging margins.Matrix height can be trimmed for use in diastema closure cases.35 left-facing wedges35 right-facing wedges",,,Plak Smacker,Restorative,https://www.youngspecialties.com/product/burtonbands-anterior-kit/,"https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/BurtonBands-Anterior-Kit-1-150x150.jpg,https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BurtonBands-Anterior-Kit-2-150x150.jpg"

No special tools are required.The BurtonBands system is also designed to be ring compatible to accommodate unique cases or practitioner preference.Simplifies matrix placement and wedging into a single, predictable step.Consistently seals the gingival margin, eliminating overhangs.Eliminates the need for a ring, which provides for increased access to the tooth preparation.Allows for control of proximal contact positioning.Creates properly-contoured restorations.Significantly decreases post-polymerization finishing time.Works well in sub-gingival cases.Single-use components eliminate the need for sterilization.40 left-facing split-wedges (20 small, 20 large)40 right-facing split-wedges (20 small, 20 large)80 Wedge210  with Wedge2",,,Plak Smacker,Restorative,https://www.youngspecialties.com/product/burtonbands-posterior-kit/,"https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BurtonBands-Posterior-MatrixSystem-150x150.png,https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BurtonBands-Posterior-MatrixSystem-150x150.png,https://www.youngspecialties.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_4316-150x150.jpg"
